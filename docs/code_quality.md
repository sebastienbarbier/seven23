# Code Quality

Maintaining high code quality is essential for a maintainable and robust project. This document outlines the formatting and code-quality tools used in this project.

## Formatting Rules

Consistent formatting improves code readability and maintainability. We utilize Prettier for automatic code formatting.

**Using Prettier:**

Prettier automatically formats your code according to the project's configuration.

Here are the available commands:

- `npm run format`: Runs Prettier to check for format issues.
- `npm run format:fix`: Formats all code files and saves the changes.

## Code Quality

Linting enforces consistent coding style and catches potential errors. We use ESLint for static code analysis.

**Using ESLint:**

ESLint scans your code for potential issues and stylistic inconsistencies.

Here are the available commands:

- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for errors and style issues.
- `npm run lint:fix` (Optional): Attempts to automatically fix some ESLint problems.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the provided tools, you can ensure your code adheres to consistent formatting and coding practices, leading to a higher quality project.
