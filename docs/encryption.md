# Encryption

Seven23 utilizes robust encryption mechanisms to safeguard user data confidentiality. This document outlines the core cryptographic concepts and libraries employed to achieve this goal.

## Dependencies

The project uses the recommended [`panva/jose`](https://github.com/panva/jose) library. This library leverage the browserâ€™s native encryption capabilities to ensure a smooth and secure user experience.

## Secret Key

The secret key is generated from the password of the user thanks to the [MD5 message-digest algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5). The main purpose here is to allow users to store they secret key without storing their password.

:::{note}
Forgetting your password will also provoke a lost of the ecnryption key. It is so recommanded to store as a backup the MD5 version of your secret key.

## JWK

The secret key is used to generate a [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/importKey#json_web_key) enforcing encryption with `A256KW`. It also use the [`AES-KW`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/wrapKey#aes-kw) algorithm for key wrapping.

## JWE

Seven23 leverages the generated JWK for both encryption and decryption processes. The chosen algorithm combination, `"A128CBC-HS256"`, offers a well-balanced approach, prioritizing both security and performance:

- `A128CBC`: This refers to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. It's a widely adopted and secure symmetric encryption algorithm.
- `HS256`: This indicates the use of HMAC-SHA256 for message authentication. This ensures data integrity throughout the encryption and decryption processes.
