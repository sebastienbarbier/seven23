How to contribute
-----------------

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Seven23 webapp!

.. note::
    We love community feedback and are glad to review contributions of any size - from typos in the documentation to critical bug fixes - so don’t be shy!


Report bugs
-----------

Report bugs at https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/seven23_webapp/issues/new

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix bugs
--------

Check out the `open bugs <https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/seven23_webapp/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20bug>`_ - anything
tagged with the |easy-pick label|_ could be a good choice for newcomers.

.. |easy-pick label| replace:: **😉 easy-pick** label
.. _`easy-pick label`: https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/seven23_webapp/labels/%F0%9F%98%89%20easy-pick

Implement features
------------------

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with |enhancement|_
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

.. |enhancement| replace:: **✨ enhancement**
.. _enhancement:  https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/seven23_webapp/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20enhancement


Write documentation
-------------------

Seven23 could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the Web in blog posts, articles, and such.

This official documentation is maintained in GitHub. The docs folder contains the documentation sources in reStructuredText format. And you can generate the docs locally with:

.. code:: shell

    make docs

Output is written at ``docs/_build/html/index.html``.

We obviously accept pull requests for this documentation, just as we accept them for bug fixes and features!
