# Testing

Thorough testing is crucial for building confidence in your code's functionality. This document outlines the different testing approaches used in this project.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on isolating and testing individual units of code, typically functions or components. These tests ensure that each unit operates as expected independently.

**Running Unit Tests:**

Use the following command to execute the unit test suite:

- `npm run test`

## End-to-End Tests (E2E Tests)

End-to-end tests simulate real user interactions and verify the overall functionality of your application. These tests ensure that different parts of your system work together seamlessly.

**Running End-to-End Tests:**

Use the following command to execute the end-to-end test suite:

- `npm run e2e:cli`

By incorporating both unit and end-to-end tests, you can catch issues at various levels and gain a higher degree of confidence in your code's reliability.
